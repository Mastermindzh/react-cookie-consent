## [[0.7.0](https://github.com/TPN-Labs/react-cookie-tailor/releases/tag/0.7.0)]

Our team was looking for a cookie consent solution that was easy to use and looked good. We will write here what was
added, changed, updated, and removed from the original library.

### Added

- Removed `@mui/material` dependency and replaced it with `tailwindcss` because mui was too heavy for our needs.
- Cookies categories
- A way to replace the translations

### Updated

- Bumped `size-limit` from `7.0.8` to `11.0.0`

### Removed

- By default, the library will appear at the bottom of the page. You can not change this behavior anymore.
