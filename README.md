## Installation

```shell
npm install react-cookie-consent
```

or use yarn:

```shell
yarn add react-cookie-consent
```

## Using it

You can import the cookie bar like this:

```js
import CookieConsent from "react-cookie-consent";
```

If you want to set/remove cookies yourself you can optionally import `Cookies` (straight from js-cookie) like this:

```js
import CookieConsent, { Cookies } from "react-cookie-consent";
```

Then you can use the component anywhere in your React app like so:

```jsx
<CookieConsent>This website uses cookies to enhance the user experience.</CookieConsent>
```

You can optionally set some props like this (next chapter will show all props):

```js
<CookieConsent
  location="bottom"
  buttonText="Sure man!!"
  cookieName="myAwesomeCookieName2"
  style={{ background: "#2B373B" }}
  buttonStyle={{ color: "#4e503b", fontSize: "13px" }}
  expires={150}
>
  This website uses cookies to enhance the user experience.{" "}
  <span style={{ fontSize: "10px" }}>This bit of text is smaller :O</span>
</CookieConsent>
```

One of the props (onAccept) is a function, this function will be called after the user has clicked the accept button. It is called with an object containing a boolean property `acceptedByScrolling` to indicate if the acceptance was triggered by the user scrolling You can provide a function like so:

```js
<CookieConsent
  onAccept={(acceptedByScrolling) => {
    if (acceptedByScrolling) {
      // triggered if user scrolls past threshold
      alert("Accept was triggered by user scrolling");
    } else {
      alert("Accept was triggered by clicking the Accept button");
    }
  }}
></CookieConsent>
```

If the decline button is enabled then the (onDecline) prop function can be used, this function will be called after the user has clicked the decline button. You can enable the button and provide a function like so:

```js
<CookieConsent
  enableDeclineButton
  onDecline={() => {
    alert("nay!");
  }}
></CookieConsent>
```

### getting the cookies value in your own code

react-cookie-consent exports a function called `getCookieConsentValue`. You can use it in your own code like so:

```js
import CookieConsent, { Cookies, getCookieConsentValue } from "react-cookie-consent";

console.log(getCookieConsentValue());
```

### reset the cookies value in your own code

react-cookie-consent exports a function called `resetCookieConsentValue`. You can use it in order to remove cookie in client-site:

```js
import CookieConsent, { Cookies, resetCookieConsentValue } from "react-cookie-consent";

console.log(resetCookieConsentValue());
```

That option would be interesting if you want to allow user to change their consent. If you want to show again the consent bar, you must force "visible" prop to show again the bar.

## Debugging it

Because the cookie consent bar will be hidden once accepted, you will have to set the prop `debug={true}` to evaluate styling changes:

```js
<CookieConsent debug={true}></CookieConsent>
```

**Note:** Don't forget to remove the `debug`-property for production.

## Why are there two cookies? One of which named "Legacy"

The short story is that some browsers don't support the SameSite=None attribute.
The modern browsers force you to have SameSite set to something other than none.

So react-cookie-consent fixes this like so:

- set the fallback cookie (e.g -legacy) first, this will always succeed (on all browsers)
- set the correct cookie second (this will work on modern browsers, fail on older ones)

This happens on lines [186-192](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/react-cookie-consent/blob/master/src/index.js#L186-L192)

When checking the cookie it'll do it in reverse. If the regular cookie exists, it'll use that. If no regular cookie exists it'll check whether the legacy cookie exists. If both are non-existent no consent was given.

The long story can be found here: [pull-request#68](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/react-cookie-consent/pull/68)

## Styling it

You can provide styling for the bar, the button and the content. Note that the bar has a `display: flex` property as default and is parent to its children "content" and "button".

The styling behaves kind of responsive. The minimum content width has been chosen to be "300px" as a default value. If the button does not fit into the same line it is wrapped around into the next line.

You can style each component by using the `style`, `buttonStyle` and `contentStyle` prop. These will append / replace the default styles of the components.
Alternatively you can provide CSS classnames as `containerClasses`, `buttonClasses` and `contentClasses` to apply predefined CSS classes.

You can use `disableStyles={true}` to disable any built-in styling.

### Examples

#### Changing the bar background to red

```js
<CookieConsent style={{ background: "red" }}></CookieConsent>
```

#### Changing the button font-weight to bold

```js
<CookieConsent buttonStyle={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}></CookieConsent>
```

#### Using predefined CSS classes

You can pass predefined CSS classes to the components using the `containerClasses`, `buttonClasses` and `contentClasses` props. The example below uses bootstrap classes:

```js
<CookieConsent
  disableStyles={true}
  location={OPTIONS.BOTTOM}
  buttonClasses="btn btn-primary"
  containerClasses="alert alert-warning col-lg-12"
  contentClasses="text-capitalize"
>
  This website uses cookies to enhance the user experience.{" "}
  <span style={{ fontSize: "10px" }}>This bit of text is smaller :O</span>
</CookieConsent>
```

Which results in:

#### Accept on scroll

You can make the cookiebar disappear after scrolling a certain percentage using acceptOnScroll and acceptOnScrollPercentage.
It is legal in some use-cases, [Italy](https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9679893) being one of them. Consult your legislation on whether this is allowed.

```js
<CookieConsent
  acceptOnScroll={true}
  acceptOnScrollPercentage={50}
  onAccept={(byScroll) => {
    alert(`consent given. \n\n By scrolling? ${byScroll}`);
  }}
>
  Hello scroller :)
</CookieConsent>
```

#### Flipping the buttons

If you enable the decline button you can pass along the "flipButtons" property to turn the buttons around:

```js
<CookieConsent enableDeclineButton flipButtons>
  Flipped buttons
</CookieConsent>
```

Which results in:

![flipped buttons](./images/flipped.png)

#### Extra cookie options

You can add more cookie options using the extraCookieOptions parameter like so:

```js
<CookieConsent extraCookieOptions={{ domain: "myexample.com" }}>cookie bar</CookieConsent>
```

#### Rainbows!

![rainbows!](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/react-cookie-consent/blob/master/images/rainbow.png?raw=true)

If you're crazy enough you can even make a rainbow colored bar:

```js
<CookieConsent
  buttonText="OMG DOUBLE RAINBOW"
  cookieName="myAwesomeCookieName2"
  style={{
    background: "linear-gradient(to right, orange , yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet)",
    textShadow: "2px 2px black",
  }}
  buttonStyle={{
    background: "linear-gradient(to left, orange , yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet)",
    color: "white",
    fontWeight: "bolder",
    textShadow: "2px 2px black",
  }}
>
  This website uses cookies to enhance the user experience.{" "}
  <span style={{ fontSize: "10px" }}>This bit of text is smaller :O</span>
</CookieConsent>
```

#### Overlay

![overlay](https://github.com/Mastermindzh/react-cookie-consent/blob/master/images/overlay.png?raw=true)

You can also generate a page-obfuscating overlay that will prevent actions other than interacting with the cookie consent button(s).

```js
<CookieConsent location="bottom" cookieName="myAwesomeCookieName3" expires={999} overlay>
  This website uses cookies to enhance the user experience.
</CookieConsent>
```

## Contributor information

When making a PR please think about the following things:

- Update the ChangeLog (or include what you did in the PR and I'll add it, up to you)
- No need to build or update the package.json. I will do both on release.
- Please don't change code convention / style
