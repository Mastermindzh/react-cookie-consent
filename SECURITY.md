   - Description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
   - Detailed steps required to reproduce the issue.
   - Your contact information for follow-up and coordination.

3. You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

4. Please do not disclose the issue to the public until we've had a chance to address it. We'll work with you to assess the vulnerability, and if necessary, we will coordinate a release that includes a patch and provides upgrade instructions.
